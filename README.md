# DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!
I am a data analyst with a background in Computer Engineering.Getting insights out of data is something I really love to do. I am able to achieve this by using various tools and technologies to collect, organise, and analyze data in order to make informed business decisions.
I have always enjoyed solving mathematical problems, even as a young child. So thats how I approach any data set: to me it is one problem I want to solve. Finding solutions nobody else can see is the challenge to me.
I am passionate about working with organisations across any field of data, seeking to make effective use of their data. I would love to help you out if you have a project in whatever area! I have experience with analyzing and cleaning data using Excel, SQL, Python along with creating data visualizations using Power BI and Tableau.
I am certain that my proficiency in data analytics, backed by experience, positions me as an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I genuinely believe that you find my portfolio to be enlightening and engaging. I welcome any opportunity you provide to discuss my qualifications further with you.
Have fun browsing through the content and thank you for visiting!
